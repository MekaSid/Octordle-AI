This is a project in CSC 480 at Cal Poly taught by Rodrigo Canaan.
This project is based on [insert external resources here: (libraries, competition frameworks, etc.)]
[insert clear instructions for how to install any dependencies and how to run the main use cases with various parameters.]
- For example, if you implemented various agents that play tic-tac-toe on a board of any size versus either a human or another agent , your readme should inform the reader how to play as a human versus any of the agents, on a board of any size.
[insert instructions for how to reproduce the main results in your report, or has links to any tables, graphics and summarizations of the result.]
- For example, if you validated a heuristic agent and a tree search agent by having them play 10k matches against each other, your readme should also inform the reader how to run that evaluation scenario. If you collected data about a high number of agents, it should also include a table that summarizes the result of each match-up.
